## Introduction

The Ledger Nano S and X are hardware wallets that support multiple cryptocurrencies, including NEM.

A hardware wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet where you can store your private keys on a physical device. 
It's a secure and simultaneously user-friendly way to access your coins, as the private key is stored on the device and doesn't get leaked.
Your coins are safe even when connected to an infected or malicious computer or a phishing/scam web page.

NEM Wallet for Desktop allows you to send and receive NEM assets using a Ledger hardware wallet. Along with providing support for XEM, the Ledger device can also offer support for tokens created on the NEM blockchain.

**IMPORTANT**: When initializing a transaction in your NEM Wallet, always verify if the data (e.g. NEM address, XEM amount) matches with the corresponding data displayed on your Ledger device. If the two data match, you can proceed with the transaction; otherwise, you should NOT continue.
